// in JS the if statements work similarly as with python. Except you have to specify the variables you're comparing or 
// testing every single time. 

// The structure switch works similarly, where 'switch' and 'case' are the keywords that specify the conditions as with the 'if' statement.
// 'case' works almost like elif, adding conditions everytime, except it must be used from the first condiction.
// Whereas 'default' works exactly like 'else', specifying what happens if none of those conditions turn out to be true.

// below is an exemple of another type of synthax for representing conditions. The " ? ".

let age2 = prompt('age?', 18);

// exercise 01:

let number1 = prompt('What is the number?', '');

// Interesting application of Switch:

// Get number corresponding to the current month, with 0 being January and 11 being December
const month = new Date().getMonth();

switch (month) {
	// January, February, March

	case 1:

	case 3:
	case 4:
	case 5:
		console.log("Spring");
		break;
	// July, August, September
	case 6:
	case 7:
	case 8:
		console.log("Summer");
		break;
	// October, November, December
	case 9:
	case 10:
	case 11:
